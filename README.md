You will find in this project : 

- A file "ECO09pagepublique.pdf" briefly describing the objectives of the project

- A "data" folder consisting of text files containing all the data used for training the classification algorithms.

> :warning: It is important not to modify the content


- A jupyter notebook "notebook_final" which contains all the commented code from the training of the algorithms to the display of the results

> :warning: You must download the geemap library for the notebook to work. This can normally be done by uncommenting "!pip Install geemap".

- A Jupiter notebook "final_app" whose code is not commented, and which aims to be used as an interactive application, with the module voil√†. The installation of this module is detailed at the top of the notebook.



Remember to clean the outputs of the cells of the notebook when leaving it, in order to avoid saving and management errors (Menu Cell/All output/Clear).


Good use of tools!
